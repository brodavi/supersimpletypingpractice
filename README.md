## This is just a super simple typing practice app.

It allows you to enter your own training sequence and save it to localstorage.


I created this because I have a weird keyboard (Kinesis Advantage2), and none of the training apps I saw online helped me train with the keys I really needed to train with (parens, curly braces, control-key combos, etc). Maybe I just didn't look hard enough, but I figured how hard could it be. Thus this was born.


You will want to run a simple http server to serve the files. That is all that is required. Here are a few:
