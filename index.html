      <summary>How to use:</summary>
      <p>
        Click "start practicing using the sequences above" if you wish to use the default practice sequences. You can also enter your own sequences, described below.
      </p>
      <p>
        As demonstrated in the default sequences above, you can add single characters or multiple characters to the sequence array, surrounded by double-quotes. If you want to practice with non-character keys such as the arrow keys, tab, etc, you can add them as specially-spelled words. They must be spelled exactly as you see here, and they must be separated by the interpunct: "·".
      </p>
      <p>
        Click the "save to localstorage" button to save your custom training sequence to your browser's storage. Click "load from localstorage" to restore from your browser's storage.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          NOTE! If you attempt to add control key sequences like "Alt-F4" or "Control-w" or "Control-n" and other such system or app-level combos, you WILL perform these actions (closing the window, the tab, opening a new tab, etc). These combos will vary for your browser and OS, so please take care. Also, you can't train on SHIFT alone... only in combos ala "Shift-ArrowUp" and of course upper-case characters and special characters ala "$".
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Also Note: There is no "end". This will just loop through the given sequence forever.
